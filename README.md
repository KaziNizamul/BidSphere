Installating and running
use npx create-react-app bidsphere
The above command creates a new react application  with a default project structure
We use npm run start to run the development server for react application

Deployment
To deploy the frontend application I'm using vercel. Vercel offers a comprehensive platform whihc helps in prioritising simplicity, performance, and developer experience for frontend application deployment.
